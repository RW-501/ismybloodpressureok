						<h4>Desired & Normal Blood Pressure</h4>
		<div class="row mt centered">	
       <h2>What is normal blood pressure?</h2>
        <p>Blood pressure is the force of blood against the walls of your arteries. When your heart beats, it pumps blood into your arteries, causing the pressure to rise. When your heart rests between beats, the pressure falls. Normal blood pressure at rest is within the range of <span class="highlight">100-140 mmHg systolic</span> and <span class="highlight">60-90 mmHg diastolic</span>.</p>
      </div>
      
      <p>If your blood pressure is consistently within this range, you are considered to have normal blood pressure. However, it's important to remember that blood pressure can fluctuate throughout the day and can be affected by many factors, including stress, physical activity, and medication. If you are concerned about your blood pressure, it's always a good idea to speak with your healthcare provider.</p>

						<h4>Prehypertension and High-Normal Blood Pressure</h4>
		<div class="row mt centered">	
	
	      <h2>What is prehypertension?</h2>
        <p>Prehypertension is a condition where blood pressure is consistently elevated, but not yet in the range of hypertension. The prehypertension range is typically defined as <span class="highlight">120-139 mmHg systolic</span> or <span class="highlight">80-89 mmHg diastolic</span>.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="info">
        <h2>What is high-normal blood pressure?</h2>
        <p>High-normal blood pressure is another term used to describe blood pressure that is on the high end of the normal range. High-normal blood pressure is typically defined as <span class="highlight">130-139 mmHg systolic</span> or <span class="highlight">85-89 mmHg diastolic</span>.</p>
      </div>
      
      <p>If your blood pressure falls within the prehypertension or high-normal range, it's important to take steps to lower your blood pressure and reduce your risk of developing hypertension. Lifestyle changes such as maintaining a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet, reducing salt intake, exercising regularly, and limiting alcohol consumption can all help lower blood pressure. Your healthcare provider may also recommend medication to lower your blood pressure if lifestyle changes alone are not effective.</p>
      
      <p>If you have prehypertension or high-normal blood pressure, it's important to monitor your blood pressure regularly and work with your healthcare provider to develop a plan to manage your blood pressure and reduce your risk of developing hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases.</p>

						<h4>Systolic Hypertension</h4>
		<div class="row mt centered">	
	
	   <p>Systolic hypertension is a condition where the systolic blood pressure consistently measures at or above <span style="font-weight: bold;">140 mmHg</span>. This means that the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats is too high. Systolic hypertension can occur in people of all ages, but it is more common as people get older.</p>
      
      <p>If left untreated, systolic hypertension can increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, and other health problems. It's important to work with your healthcare provider to manage your blood pressure and reduce your risk of complications.</p>
      
      <p>Lifestyle changes such as maintaining a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet, reducing salt intake, exercising regularly, and limiting alcohol consumption can all help lower blood pressure.

This means that the pressure in your arteries is higher than the normal range, but not yet at a level that is considered high blood pressure.</p>
      
      <p>If you have been diagnosed with stage 1 hypertension, it's important to work with your healthcare provider to manage your blood pressure and reduce your risk of developing more serious health problems. Lifestyle changes such as maintaining a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet, reducing salt intake, exercising regularly, and limiting alcohol consumption can all help lower blood pressure.</p>

At this stage, the risk of developing serious health problems such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney damage increases significantly.</p>
      
      <p>If you have been diagnosed with stage 2 hypertension, it's important to work closely with your healthcare provider to manage your blood pressure and reduce your risk of developing more serious health problems. Lifestyle changes such as maintaining a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet, reducing salt intake, exercising regularly, and limiting alcohol consumption can all help lower blood pressure.</p>

While hypotension can be asymptomatic or mild, it can also cause significant symptoms and complications.</p>
      
      <p>Some common symptoms of hypotension include dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, blurred vision, fatigue, and nausea. Hypotension can also cause complications such as shock, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.</p>
      
      <p>The causes of hypotension can vary and may include underlying medical conditions such as heart disease, dehydration, anemia, medication side effects, or a sudden change in position such as standing up too quickly.</p>
      
      <p>If you have hypotension, it's important to work closely with your healthcare provider to manage your condition and prevent complications. Treatment may include addressing underlying medical conditions, adjusting medication dosages, increasing salt and fluid intake, or wearing compression stockings to help improve circulation.</p>
      
      <p>If you experience symptoms of hypotension, it's important to seek medical attention right away, especially if you have a history of heart disease or other medical conditions. Your healthcare provider can help you develop a plan to manage your hypotension and reduce your risk of complications.</p>

 <p>Hypertensive emergency is a severe and potentially life-threatening condition in which a person's blood pressure rises to dangerously high levels, usually above <span style="font-weight: bold;">180/120 mmHg</span>. This condition requires immediate medical attention as it can cause damage to organs such as the brain, heart, and kidneys.</p>
      
      <p>Hypertensive emergency can cause symptoms such as severe headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, blurred vision, and confusion. If left untreated, hypertensive emergency can lead to serious complications such as stroke, heart attack, kidney failure, and even death.</p>
      
      <p>If you are experiencing symptoms of hypertensive emergency, it is important to seek immediate medical attention by calling your local emergency number or going to the nearest emergency room. Treatment for hypertensive emergency may include medications to lower blood pressure and manage symptoms, as well as monitoring and treating any organ damage that may have occurred.</p>

						<h2>Remedies for Managing High Blood Pressure</h2>
		<div class="row mt centered">	
	
<div class="column">
			<p><strong>1. Exercise regularly:</strong> Regular physical activity can help lower blood pressure by strengthening the heart and improving circulation. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week, such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming.</p>
			<p><strong>2. Maintain a healthy weight:</strong> Being overweight or obese can increase blood pressure. If you're overweight, losing even a small amount of weight can help lower blood pressure.</p>
			<p><strong>3. Follow a healthy diet:</strong> Eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help lower blood pressure. Avoid processed foods, saturated and trans fats, and excess salt.</p>
			<p><strong>4. Reduce stress:</strong> Chronic stress can contribute to high blood pressure. Try relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga to help reduce stress.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="column">
			<p><strong>5. Limit alcohol consumption:</strong> Drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure. Limit your alcohol consumption to no more than one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men.</p>
			<p><strong>6. Quit smoking:</strong> Smoking can damage blood vessels and contribute to high blood pressure. Quitting smoking can help lower blood pressure and reduce your risk of other health problems.</p>
			<p><strong>7. Use herbs and supplements:</strong> Certain herbs and supplements, such as garlic, omega-3 fatty acids, and coenzyme Q10, may help lower blood pressure. However, it's important to talk to your doctor before taking any new supplements, as they may interact with other medications you're taking.</p>
